INTRODUCTORY.


|Somewhere in that uncertain "long ago,"

Whose dim and vague chronology is all

That elfin tales or nursery fables know,

Rose a rare spirit,--keen, and quick, and quaint,--

          Whom by the title, whether fact or feint,

               Mythic or real, Mother Goose we call.



          Of Momus and Minerva sprang the birth

          That gave the laughing oracle to earth:

          A brimming bowl she bears, that, frothing

                    high

          With sparkling nonsense, seemeth non-

                    sense all;

          Till, the bright, floating syllabub blown by,

          Lo, in its ruby splendor doth upshine

          The crimson radiance of Olympian wine

               By Pallas poured, in Jove's own banquet-

                    hall.



          The world was but a baby when she came;

          So to her songs it listened, and her name

          Grew to a word of power, her voice a spell

          With charm to soothe its infant wearying

                    well.



          But, in a later and maturer age,

          Developed to a dignity more sage,

          Having its Shakspeares and its Words-

                    worths now,

          Its Southeys and its Tennysons, to wear

          A halo on the high and lordly brow,

          Or poet-laurels in the waving hair;

          Its Lowells, Whittiers, Longfellows, to sing

          Ballads of beauty, like the notes of spring,

          The wise and prudent ones to nursery use

          Leave the dear lyrics of old Mother Goose.



          Wisdom of babes,--the nursery Shak-

                    speare stilly--

          Cackles she ever with the same good-will:

          Uttering deep counsels in a foolish guise,

          That come as warnings, even to the wise;

          As when, of old, the martial city slept,

          Unconscious of the wily foe that crept

          Under the midnight, till the alarm was heard

          Out from the mouth of Rome's plebeian

                    bird.



          Full many a rare and subtile thing hath

                    she,

          Undreamed of in the world's philosophy:

          Toss-balls for children hath she humbly

                    rolled,

          That shining jewels secretly enfold;

          Sibylline leaves she casteth on the air,

          Twisted in fool's-caps, blown unheeded by,

          That, in their lines grotesque, albeit, bear

          Words of grave truth, and signal prophecy;

          And lurking satire, whose sharp lashes hit

          A world of follies with their homely writ;

          With here and there a roughly uttered hint,

          That makes you wonder at the beauty

                    in't;

          As if, along the wayside's dusty edge,

          A hot-house flower had blossomed in a

                    hedge.



          So, like brave Layard in old Nineveh,

          Among the memories of ancient song,

          As curious relics, I would fain bestir;

          And gather, if it might be, into strong

               And shapely show, some wealth of its

                    lost lore;

          Fragments of Truth's own architecture,

                    strewed

          In forms disjointed, whimsical, and rude,

          That yet, to simpler vision, grandly stood

          Complete, beneath the golden light of




BRAHMIC.


|If a great poet think he sings,

               Or if the poem think it's sung,

          They do but sport the scattered plumes

               That Mother Goose aside hath flung.



          Far or forgot to me is near:

               Shakspeare and Punch are all the same;

          The vanished thoughts do reappear,

               And shape themselves to fun or fame.



          They use my _quills_, and leave me out,

               Oblivious that I wear the _wings_;

          Or that a Goose has been about,

               When every little gosling sings.



          Strong men may strive for grander thought,

               But, six times out of every seven,

          My old philosophy hath taught

               All they can master this side heaven.




LITTLE BOY BLUE.


               "Little boy blue! come blow your horn!

               The sheep in the meadow, the cows in the corn!

               Where's little boy blue, that looks after the sheep?

               He's under the hay-mow, fast asleep!"


|Of morals in novels, we've had not a few;

          With now and then novel moralities too;

          And we 've weekly exhortings from pulpit

               to pew;

          But it strikes me,--and so it may chance

               to strike you,--

          Scarce any are better than "Little Boy

               Blue."



          For the veteran dame knows her business:

               right well,

          And her quaint admonitions unerringly

               tell:

          She strings a few odd, careless words in a

               jingle,

          And the sharp, latent truth fairly makes

               your ears tingle.



          "Azure-robed Youth!" she cries, "up to

               thy post!

          And watch, lest thy wealth be all scattered

               and lost:

          Silly thoughts are astray, beyond call of

               the horn,

          And passion breaks loose, and gets into the

               corn!



          Is this the way Conscience looks after her

               sheep?

          In the world's soothing shadow, gone sound-

               ly asleep?"



          Is n't _that_, now, a sermon? No lengthened

               vexation

          Of heads, and divisions, and argumenta-

               tion,

          But a straightforward leap to the sure ap-

               plication;

          And, though many a longer harangue is

               forgot,

          Of which careful reporters take notes on

               the spot,

          I think,--as the "Deacon" declared of his

               "shay,"

          Put together for lasting for ever and aye,--

          A like immortality holding in view,

          The old lady's discourse will undoubtedly

               "dew"!




HICCOKY, DICCORY, DOCK.


                    "Hiccory, diccory, dock!

                    The mouse ran up the clock.

               The clock struck one, and down she run:

                    Hiccory, diccory, dock!"


|She had her simple nest in a safe and cun-

               ning place,

          Away down in the quiet of the deep, old-

               fashioned case.

          A little crevice nibbled out led forth into

               the world,

          And overhead, on busy wheels, the hours

               and minutes whirled.



          High up in mystic glooms of space was

               awful scenery

          Of wires, and weights, and springs, and all

               great Time's machinery;

          But she had nought to do with these; a

               blessed little mouse,

          Whose only care beneath the sun was just

               to keep her house.



          For this was all she knew, or could; with-

               out her, just the same

          The earth's great centre drew the weight;

               the pendulum went and came;

          And days were born, and grew, and died;

               and stroke by stroke were told

          The hours by which the world and men

               are ever growing old.



          It suddenly occurred to her,--it struck her

               all at once,--

          That living among things of power, her-

               self had been a dunce.

          "Somebody winds the clock!" she cried

               "Somebody comes and brings

          An iron finger that feels through and fum-

               bles at the springs;



          "And then it happens; then the buzz is

               stirred afar and near,

          And the hour sounds, and everywhere the

               great world stops to hear.

          I don't think, after all, it seems so hard a

               thing to do.

          I know the way--I might run up and

               make folks listen too."



          She sprang upon the leaden weight; but

               not the merest whit

          Did all her added gravity avail to hurry it.

          She clambered up the steady cord; it wav-

               ered not a hair.

          She got among the earnest wheels; they

               knew not she was there.



          She sat beside the silent bell; the patient

               hammer lay

          Waiting an unseen bidding for the word

               that it should say.

          Only a solemn whisper thrilled the cham-

               bers of the clock,

          And the mouse listened: "Hiccory! hie--

               diccory! die--dock!"



          Something was coming. She had hit the

               ripeness of the time;

          No tiny second was outreached by that ex-

               ultant climb;

          In no wise did the planet turn the faster to

               the sun;

          She only met the instant, but the great

               clock sounded--"One!"

          What then? Did she stand gloriously

               among those central things,

          Her eye upon the vibrant bell, her heel

               upon the springs?

          Was her soul grand in unison with that

               resounding chime,

          And her pulse-beat identical with the high

               pulse of Time?



          Ah, she was little! When the air first

               shattered with that shock,

          Down ran the mouse into her hole. "Hic,

               diccory! die--dock!"

          Too plain to be translated is the truth the

               tale would show,

          Small souls, in solemn upshot, had better

               wait below.






BO-PEEP.


          "Little Bo-Peep

               Has lost her sheep,

          And does n't know where to find 'em;

               Let 'em alone,

               And they 'll come home,

          And bring their tails behind 'em."


|Hope beckoned Youth, and bade him keep,

          On Life's broad plain, his shining sheep,

          And while along the sward they came,

          He called them over, each by name;

          This one was Friendship,--that was Health;

          Another Love,--another Wealth;

          One, fat, full-fleeced, was Social Station;

          Another, stainless, Reputation;

          In truth, a goodly flock of sheep,--

          A goodly flock, but hard to keep.



          Youth laid him down beside a fountain;

          Hope spread his wings to scale a mountain;

          And, somehow, Youth fell fast asleep,

          And left his crook to tend the sheep:

          No wonder, as the legend says,

          They took to very crooked ways.



          He woke--to hear a distant bleating,--

          The faithless quadrupeds were fleeting!



          Wealth vanished first, with stealthy tread,

          Then Friendship followed--to be fed,--

          And foolish Love was after led;

          Fair Fame,--alas! some thievish scamp

          Had marked him with his own black stamp!

          And he, with Honor at his heels,

          Was out of sight across the fields.



          Health just hangs doubtful,--distant Hope

          Looks backward from the mountain slope,--

          And Youth himself--no longer Youth--

          Stands face to face with bitter Truth.



          Yet let them go! 'T were all in vain

               To linger here in faith to find 'em;

          Forward!--nor pause to think of pain,--

          Till somewhere, on a nobler plain,

          A surer Hope shall lead the train

          Of joys withheld to come again

               With golden fleeces trailed behind 'em!






SOLOMON GRUNDY.


               "Solomon Grundy

               Born on Monday,

               Christened on Tuesday,

               Married on Wednesday,

               Sick on Thursday,

               Worse on Friday,

               Dead on Saturday,

               Buried on Sunday:

               This was the end

               Of Solomon Grundy."



          So sings the unpretentious Muse

          That guides the quill of Mother Goose,

          And in one week of mortal strife

          Presents the epitome of Life:

          But down sits Billy Shakspeare next,

          And, coolly taking up the text,

          His thought pursues the trail of mine,

          And, lo! the "Seven Ages" shine!

          O world! O critics! _can't_ you see

          How Shakspeare plagiarizes me?



          And other bards will after come,

               To echo in a later age,

          "He lived,--he died: behold the sum,

               The abstract of the historian's page"

          Yet once for all the thing was done,

               Complete in Grundy's pilgrimage.



          For not a child upon the knee

          But hath the moral learned of me;

          And measured, in a seven days' span,

          The whole experience of man.






BOWLS.


               "Three wise men of Gotham

                    Went to sea in a bowl:

               If the bowl had been stronger,

               My song had been longer."


|Mysteriously suggestive! A vague hint,

               Yet a rare touch of most effective art,

          That of the bowl, and all the voyagers in't,

               Tells nothing, save the fact that they did

                    start.



          There ending suddenly, with subtle craft,

          The story stands--as 'twere a broken

                    shafts--'

          More eloquent in mute signification,

          Than lengthened detail, or precise relation.

          So perfect in its very non-achieving,

          That, of a truth, I cannot help believing

          A rash attempt at paraphrasing it

          May prove a blunder, rather than a hit.



          Still, I must wish the venerable soul

          Had been explicit as regards the bowl

          Was it, perhaps, a railroad speculation?

          Or a big ship to carry all creation,

          That, by some kink of its machinery,

          Failed, in the end, to carry even three?

          Or other fond, erroneous calculation

          Of splendid schemes that died disastrously?



          It must have been of Gotham manufacture;

          Though strangely weak, and liable to frac-

               ture.



          Yet--pause a moment--strangely, did I

               say?

          Scarcely, since, after all, it was but clay;--

          The stuff Hope takes to build her brittle

               boat,

          And therein sets the wisest men afloat.

          Truly, a bark would need be somewhat

               stronger,

          To make the halting history much longer.



          Doubtless, the good Dame did but gener-

               alize,--

          Took a broad glance at human enterprise,

               And earthly expectation, and so drew,

          In pithy lines, a parable most true,--

          Kindly to warn us ere we sail away,

          With life's great venture, in an ark of

               clay,

Where shivered fragments all around be-

How even the "golden bowl" at last lies

broken!

CRADLED IN GREEN.


               "Rockaby, baby,

                    Your cradle is green;

               Father's a nobleman,

                    Mother's a queen;

               And Betty's a lady,

                    And wears a gold ring,

               And Johnny's a drummer,

                    And drums for the king!"



          O golden gift of childhood!

               That, with its kingly touch,

          Transforms to more than royalty

               The thing it loveth much!



          O second sight, bestowed alone

               Upon the baby seer,

          That the glory held in Heaven's reserve

               Discerneth even here!



          Though he be the humblest craftsman,

               No silk nor ermine piled

          Could make the father seem a whit

               More noble to the child;

          And the mother,--ah, what queenlier crown

               Could rest upon her brow,

          Than the fair and gentle dignity

               It weareth to him now?



          E'en the gilded ring that Michael

               For a penny fairing bought,

          Is the seal of Betty's ladyhood

               To his untutored thought;

          And the darling drum about his neck,--

               His very newest toy,--

          A bandsman unto Majesty

               Hath straightway made the boy!



          O golden gift of childhood!

               If the talisman might last,

          How the dull Present still should gleam

               With the glory of the Past!

          But the things of earth about us

               Fade and dwindle as we go,

          And the long perspective of our life

               Is truth, and not a show!






"SIMILIA SIMILIBUS."


               "There was a man in our town,

                    And he was wondrous wise:

               He jumped into a bramble-bush,

                    And scratched out both his eyes.

               But when he saw his eyes were out,

                    With all his might and main

               He jumped into another bush,

                    And scratched them in again!"


|Old Dr. Hahnemann read the tale,

               (And he was wondrous wise,)

          Of the man who, in the bramble-bush,

               Had scratched out both his eyes.



          And the fancy tickled mightily

               His misty German brain,

          That, by jumping in another bush,

               He got them back again.



          So he called it "homo-hop-athy".

               And soon it came about,

          That a curious crowd among the thorns

               Was hopping in and out.

          Yet, disguise it by the longest name

               They may, it is no use;

          For the world knows the discovery

               Was made by Mother Goose!



          And not alone in medicine

               Doth the theory hold good;

          In Life and in Philosophy,

               The maxim still hath stood:

          A morsel more of anything,

               When one has got enough,

          And Nature's energy disowns

               The whole unkindly stuff.



           A second negative affirms;

               And two magnetic poles

          Of charge identical, repel,--

               A     s sameness sunders souls.

          Touched with a first, fresh suffering,

               All solace is despised;

          But gathered sorrows grow serene,

               And grief is neutralized.



          And he who, in the world's _melee_,

               Hath chanced the worse to catch,

          May mend the matter, if he come

               Back, boldly, to the scratch;

          Minding the lesson he received

               In boyhood, from his mother.

          Whose cheery word, for many a bump,

               Was, Up and take another!






HOBBY-HORSES.


               "I had a little pony,

                    His name was Dapple Gray:

               I lent him to a lady

                    To ride a mile away.

               She whipped him,

                    She lashed him,

               She rode him through the mire;

               I would n't lend my pony now,

               For all the lady's hire."


|Our hobbies, of whatever sort

               They be, mine honest friend,

          Of fancy, enterprise, or thought,

               'T is hardly wise to lend.



          Some fair imagination, shrined

               In form poetic, maybe,

          You fondly trusted to the World,--

               That most capricious Lady.



          Or a high, romantic theory,

               Magnificently planned,

          In flush of eager confidence

               You bade her take in hand.



          But she whipped it, and she lashed it,

               And bespattered it with mire,

          Till your very soul felt stained within,

               And scourged with stripes of fire.



          Yet take this thought, and hold it fast,

               Ye Martyrs of To-day!

          That same great World, with all its scorn,

               _You 've lifted_ on its way!






MISSIONS.


               "Hogs in the garden,--

          The real lionesses fight,--

               I let it go.

          Yet, somehow, as I catch the call

               Of the world's voice,

          That speaks a summons unto all

               Its girls and boys;



          In such strange contrast still it rings

               As church-bells' bome

          To the pert sound of tinkling things

               One hears at home;



          And wakes an impulse, not germane

               Perhaps, to woman,

          Yet with a thrill that makes it plain

               'T is truly human;--



          A sudden tingle at the springs

               Of noble feeling,

          The spirit-power for valiant things

               Clearly revealing.



          But Eden's curse doth daily deal

               Its certain dole,--

          And the old grasp upon the heel

               Holds back the soul!



          So, when some rousing deed's to do,

               To save a nation,

          Or, on the mountains, to subdue

               A conflagration,

          Woman! the work is not for you;

               Mind your vocation!

          Out from the cream-pot comes a mew

               Spirit in fetters!



          Only, the hidden fires will glow,

               And, now and then,

          A beacon blazeth out below

               That startles men!



          Some Joan, through battle-field to stake,

               Danger embracing;

          Some Florence, for sweet mercy's sake

               Pestilence facing;

          Whose holy valor vindicates

               The royal birth

          That, for its crowning, only waits

               The end of earth;

          And, haply, when we all stand freed,

               In strength immortal,

          Such virgin-lamps the host shall lead

               Through heaven's portal!






GOING BACK TO OUR MUTTONS


               "There was an old man of Tobago,

               Who lived on rice, gruel, and sago,

                    Till, much to his bliss,

                    His physician said this:

               To a leg, sir, of mutton, you may go.

               He set a monkey to baste the mutton,

               And ten pounds of butter he put on."


|Chain up a child, and away he will go";

          I have heard of the proverb interpreted so;

          The spendthrift is son to the miser,--and

                    still,

          When the Devil would work his most piti-

                    less will,

          He sends forth the seven, for such embas-

                    sies kept,

          To the house that is empty and garnished

                    and swept:

          For poor human nature a pendulum seems.,

          That must constantly vibrate between two

                    extremes.



          The closer the arrow is drawn to the

                    bow,

          Once slipped from the string, all the further

                    't will go:

          Let a panic arise in the world of finance,

          And the mad flight of Fashion be checked

                    by the chance,

          It certainly seems a most wonderful thing,

          When the ropes are let go again, how it

                    will swing!



          And even the decent observance of Lent,

          Stirs sometimes a doubt how the time has

                    been spent,

          When Easter brings out the new bonnets

                    and gowns,

          And a flood of gay colors o'erflows in the

                    towns.



          So in all things the feast doth still follow

                    the fast,

          And the force of the contrast gives zest to

                    the last;

          And until he is tried, no frail mortal can

                    tell,

          The inch being offered, he won't take the

                    ell.

          We are righteously shocked at the follies

                    of fashion;

          Nay, standing outside, may get quite in a

                    passion

               At the prodigal flourishes other folks put

                    on:

          But many good people this side of Tobago,

          If respited once from their diet of sago,

               Would outdo the monkey in basting the

                    mutton!




GOING TO DOVER.


               "Leg over leg

                    As the dog went to Dover;

               When he came to a stile,

                    Jump he went over."


|Perhaps you would n't see it here,

          But, to my fancy, 't is quite clear

          That Mother Goose just meant to show

          How the dog Patience on doth go:

          With steadfast nozzle, pointing low,--

          Leg over leg, however slow,--

          And labored breath, but naught complaining,

          Still, at each footstep, somewhat gaining,--

          Quietly plodding, mile on mile,

               And gathering for a nervous bound

          At every interposing stile,--

               So traversing the tedious ground,

          Till all at length, he measures over,

               And walks, a victor, into Dover.



          And, verily, no other way

          Doth human progress win the day;

          Step after step,--and o'er and o'er,--

          Each seeming like the one before,

          So that't is only once a while,--

          When sudden Genius springs the stile

          That marks a section of the plain,

          Beyond whose bound fresh fields again

          Their widening stretch untrodden sweep,--

          The world looks round to see the leap.



          Pale Science, in her laboratory,

               Works on with crucible and wire

          Unnoticed, till an instant glory

               Crowns some high issue, as with fire,

          And men, with wondering eyes awide,

          Gauge great Invention's giant stride.



          No age, no race, no single soul,

          By lofty tumbling gains the goal.

          The steady pace it keeps between,--

          The little points it makes unseen,--

          By these, achieved in gathering might,

          It moveth on, and out of sight,

          And wins, through all that's overpast,

          The city of its hopes at last.

               While scarcely at the portal

                    The great procession flags;



               For the pillared doors of glory

                    On their hinges hang awide;

               Where each asking soul may enter,

                    And at last be satisfied!



               But a cold, calm shade arriveth,

                    In self-complacent trim,--

               And Peter riseth up to see

                    Especially to him.



               "Good morrow, saint! I'm going in

                    To take a stroll, you know;

               Not that I _want_ for anything,--

                    But just to see the show!"



               "Hold!" thunders out the warden,

                    "Be pleased to pause a bit!

               For seats celestial, let me say,

                    You 're not apparelled fit:

               _Yonder 's_ the brazen door that leads

                    Spectators to the pit!



               Whatever may be thought on earth,

                    We've other rules in heaven;

               And only poverty confessed

                    Finds free admittance given!"






BLACKBIRDS.


          "Sing a song o' sixpence, a pocket full of rye;

          Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie:

          When the pie was opened, they all began to sing,

          And was n't this a dainty dish to set before the king?

          The king was in his counting-house, counting out his

                    money;

          The queen was in the parlor, eating bread and honey;

          The maid was in the garden, hanging out the clothes,

          And along came a blackbird, and nipt off her nose!"



          It doesn't take a conjurer to see

          The sort of curious pasty this might be;

          A flock of flying rumors, caught alive,

          And housed, like swarming bees within a

                    hive,--

          Instead of what were far more wisely

                    done,

          Having their worthless necks wrung, every

                    one;--

          And so a dish of dainty gossip making,

               Smooth covered with a show of secrecy,

          That one but takes the pleasant pains of

                    breaking,

          And out the wide-mouthed knaves pop,

                    eagerly.



          Blackbirds, indeed! Each chattering on-

                    dit

          Comes forth, full feathered, black as black

                    can be;

          With quivering throats, all tremulous to

                    sing,

          And please, forsooth, some little social

                    king;

          Whose reign may last as long as he is able

          To call his court around a dinner-table.



          But, mark the sequel! When the laugh is

                    over,

          Think not to get the varlets under cover:

          The crust once broken, you may seek in vain

          To catch the birds, or coax them in again;

          Mrs. Pandora's famous box, I wis,

          Was nothing worse than such a pie as this:

          And so, some pleasant morning,--when,

                    down town,

               The king is busy with his bags of money,

          Leaving at home the queenly Mrs. Brown

               Safe at her breakfast of fair bread and

                    honey,--

          Some quiet, harmless soul, who never

                    knows

               Of any matters, save the plain pursuing

          Her daily round,--the hanging out of

                    clothes

               Or other lawful work she may be doing,--

          Finds, by the sudden nipping of her nose,

               What sort of mischief is about her brew-

                    ing!



          Not that, indeed, there's anything to hinder

          The thieves from flying though the parlor

                    window;

          For never yet could sentinel or warden

          Keep scandals wholly to the kitchen gar-

                    den.



          When, therefore, as not seldom it may be,

          Even in the soberest community,

          Strange revelations somehow get about,--

          Like a mysterious cholera breaking out

          Sudden, as Egypt's blains 'neath Aaron's rod,

          Contagious by a whisper or a nod,--

          When daily papers teem with many a hint

          That daubs them darker even than their

                    print;

          When it would seem, in short, the very D----,

          Had let his little imps out on a spree;

          Conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt,

          Although, perhaps, you fail to trace it out,

          Such plagues spring not unbidden from the

                    ground,

          And, if the thing were sifted, 't would be

                    found

          _Somebody 's_ sown a pocket full of rye,

          Or been regaling on a blackbird pie!





BANBURY CROSS.


[Illustration: 0076]

               "Ride a fine horse

                    To Banbury Cross,

               To see a young woman

                    Jump on a white horse.

               Rings on her fingers,

                    And bells on her toes,

               And she shall have music

                    Wherever she goes."



          Prophetic Dame! What hadst thou in

                    view?

          A modern wedding in Fifth Avenue?

          Where,--like the goddess of a heathen

                    shrine,

               With offerings heaped in such a glittering

                    show

          As must have emptied a Peruvian mine,

               And would suggest, but that we better

                    know,

          Marriage must be a bitter thing indeed,

               And, like the Prophet of the Eastern tale,

          Must wear a very ugly face, to need

               Such careful shrouding in the silver

                    veil,--

          Her bridal pomp, as a white palfrey, mount-

                    ing,

          Caparisoned at cost beyond all counting,

          With diamond-jewelled fingers, and the

                    toes

          Ditto, for all that anybody knows,

          The smiling damsel goeth to the Banns?

               (Why add the "bury," or suggest the

                    "cross,"

          As if such brilliant ringing of the hands

               Preluded aught of trial or of loss?)



          Shall not Life's golden bells still tinkle

                    sweet,

          And merry music make about her feet?

          Shall not the silver sheen around her spread,

          A lasting light along her pathway shed?



          No mocking satire, surely, hides a sting,

               Nor bitter irony a truth foreshows,

          In the gay chant the cheery dame doth

                    sing,--

          "She shall have music wheresoe'er she

                    goes"?



          _She_ shall have music! Shall she sit apart,

               And let the folly-chimes outvoice the

                    tone

          That comes up wailing to the listening

                    heart,

               From the great world, where misery

                    maketh moan?

          Ah, Mother Goose! if such the tale it tells,

          Sing us no more your rhyme of rings and

                    bells!



          But may not--'twere a rare device in-

                    deed!--

          The wondrous oracle in both ways read?

          And call up, as a fair beatitude,

          The gracious vision of true womanhood,

          That with pure purpose, and a gentle might,

          Upheld and borne, as by the steed of white,

          Pledged with her golden ring, goes nobly

                    forth

          To trace her path of joy along the earth,--

          And, as she moves, makes music, silver-shod

          "With preparation of the peace" of God,

          That holds the key-note of celestial cheer,

          And hangs heaven's echoes round her foot-

                    steps here?






ATTIC SALT.


               "Two little blackbirds sat upon a hill,

               One named Jack, the other named Jill

               Fly away, Jack! fly away, Jill!

               Come again, Jack! come again, Jill!"


|I half suspect that, after all,

                    There's just the smallest bit

               Of inequality between

                    The witling and the wit.

               'Tis only mental nimbleness:

                    No language ever brought

               A living word to soul of man

                    But had the latent thought.



          You may meet, among the million,

               Good people every day,--

          Unconscious martyrs to their fate,--

               Who seem, in half they say,

          On the brink of something brilliant

               They were almost sure to clinch,

          Yet, by some queer freak of fortune,

               Just escape it by an inch!



          I often think the selfsame shade,--

               This difference of a hair,--

          Divides between the men of nought

               And those who do and dare.

          An instant cometh on the wing,

               Bearing a kingly crown:

          This man is dazzled and lets it by--

               _That_ seizes and brings it down.



          Winged things may stoop to any door

               Alighting close and low;

          And up and down, 'twixt earth and sky,

               Do always come and go.

          Swift, fluttering glimpses touch us all,

               Yet, prithee, what avails?

          'Tis only Genius that can put

               The salt upon their tails!




THE BIG SHOE.


               "There was an old woman

                    Who lived in a shoe;

               She had so many children

                    She did n't know what to do:

               To some she gave broth,

                    And to some she gave bread,

               And some she whipped soundly,

                    And sent them to bed."


|Do you find out the likeness?

                    A portly old Dame,--

               The mother of millions,--

                    Britannia by name:

               And--howe'er it may strike you

                    In reading the song--

               Not stinted in space

                    For bestowing the throng;

               Since the Sun can himself

                    Hardly manage to go,

               In a day and a night,

                    From the heel to the toe.



               On the arch of the instep

                    She builds up her throne,

               And, with seas rolling under,

                    She sits there alone;

               With her heel at the foot

                    Of the Himmalehs planted,

               And her toe in the icebergs,

                    Unchilled and undaunted.



               Yet though justly of all

                    Her fine family proud,

               'Tis no light undertaking

                    To rule such a crowd;

               Not to mention the trouble

                    Of seeing them fed,

               And dispensing with justice

                    The broth and the bread.

               Some will seize upon one,--

                    Some are left with the other,

               And so the whole household

                    Gets into a pother.

               But the rigid old Dame

                    Has a summary way

               Of her own, when she finds

                    There is mischief to pay.

               She just takes up the rod,

                    As she lays down the spoon,

               And makes their rebellious backs

                    Tingle right soon:

               Then she bids them, while yet

                    The sore smarting they feel,

               To lie down, and go to sleep,

                    Under her heel!



               Only once was she posed,--

                    When the little boy Sam,

               Who had always before

                    Been as meek as a lamb,

               Refused to take tea,

                    As his mother had bid,

               And returned saucy answers

                    Because he was chid.



               Not content even then,

                    He cut loose from the throne,

               And set about making

                    A shoe of his own;

               Which succeeded so well,

                    And was filled up so fast,

               That the world, in amazement,

                    Confessed, at the last,--

               Looking on at the work

                    With a gasp and a stare,--

               That't was hard to tell which

                    Would be best of the pair.



               Side by side they are standing

                    Together to-day;

               Side by side may they keep

                    Their strong foothold for aye:

               And beneath the broad sea,

                    Whose blue depths intervene,

               May the finishing string

                    Lie unbroken between!






VICTUALS AND DRINK.


               "There once was a woman,

                    And what do you think?

               She lived upon nothing

                    But victuals and drink.

               Victuals and drink

                    "Were the chief of her diet,

               And yet this poor woman

                    Scarce ever was quiet."



               And were you so foolish

                    As really to think

               That all she could want

                    Was her victuals and drink?



               And that while she was furnished

                    With that sort of diet,

               Her feeling and fancy

                    Would starve, and be quiet?



               Mother Goose knew far better;

                    But thought it sufficient

               To give a mere hint

                    That the fare was deficient;

               For I do not believe

                    She could ever have meant

               To imply there was reason

                    For being content.



               Yet the mass of mankind

                    Is uncommonly slow

               To acknowledge the fact

                    It behooves them to know;

               Or to learn that a woman

                    Is not like a mouse,

               Needing nothing but cheese,

                    And the walls of a house.



               But just take a man,--

                    Shut him up for a day;

               Get his hat and his cane,--

                    Put them snugly away;

               Give him stockings to mend,

                    And three sumptuous meals;--

               And then ask him, at night,

               If you dare, how he feels!

               Do you think he will quietly

                    Stick to the stocking,

               While you read the news,

               And "don't care about talking?"

               O, many a woman

                    Goes starving, I ween,

               Who lives in a palace,

                    And fares like a queen;

               Till the famishing heart,

                    And the feverish brain,

               Have spelled to life's end

                    The long lesson of pain.



               Yet, stay! To my mind

                    An uneasy suggestion

               Comes up, that there may be

                    Two sides to the question.

               That, while here and there proving

                    Inflicted privation,

               The verdict must often be

                    "Wilful starvation."



               Since there _are_ men and women

                    Would force one to think

               They _choose_ to live only

                    On victuals and drink.



               O restless, and craving,

                    Unsatisfied hearts,

               Whence never the vulture

                    Of hunger departs!

               How long on the husks

                    Of your life will ye feed,

               Ignoring the soul,

                    And her famishing need?



               Bethink you, when lulled

                    In your shallow content,

               'Twas to Lazarus only

                    The angels were sent;

               And 't is he to whose lips

                    But earth's ashes are given,

               For whom the full banquet

                    Is gathered in heaven!

               "There was an old woman

               Tossed up in a blanket,

          Seventeen times as high as the moon;

               What she did there

               I cannot tell you,

          But in her hand she carried a broom.

               Old woman, old woman,

               Old woman, said I,

          O whither, O whither, O whither so high?

               To sweep the cobwebs

               Off the sky,

          And I 'll be back again, by and by."


|Mind you, she wore no _wings_,

     That she might truly _soar_; no time was lost

     In growing such unnecessary things;

          But blindly, in a blanket, she was _tost!_



               Spasmodically, too!

          'T was not enough that she should reach

               the moon;

     But seventeen times the distance she must

               do,

          Lest, peradventure, she get back too

               soon.



               That emblematic broom!

          Besom of mad Reform, uplifted high,

     That, to reach cobwebs, would precipitate

               doom,

          And sweep down thunderbolts from out

               the sky!



               Doubtless, no rubbish lay

          About her door,--no work was there to

                    do,--

     That through the astonished aisles of Night

                    and Day,

          She took her valorous flight in quest of

                    new!



               Lo! at her little broom

          The great stars laugh, as on their wheels

                    of fire

     They go, dispersing the eternal gloom,

          And shake Time's dust from off each

                    blazing tire!



               "Little Miss Muffet

                    Sat on a tuffet,

               Eating curds and whey:

                    There came a black spider,

                    And sat down beside her,

               And frightened Miss Muffet away,"


|To all mortal blisses,

               From comfits to kisses,

     There's sure to be something by way of

                    alloy;

               Each new expectation

               Brings fresh aggravation,

     And a doubtful amalgam's the best of our

               You may sit on your tuffet;

               Yes,--cushion and stuff it;

     And provide what you please, if you don't

                    fancy whey;

               But before you can eat it,

               There 'll be--I repeat it--

     Some sort of black spider to come in the

DAFFY-DOWN-DILLY.


               "Daffy-down-dilly

                    Is new come to town,

               With a petticoat green,

                    And a bright yellow gown,

               And her little white blossoms

                    Are peeping around."


|Now don't you call this

               A most exquisite thing?

          Don't it give you a thrill

               With the thought of the spring,

          Such as once, in your childhood,

               You felt, when you found

          The first yellow buttercups

               Spangling the ground?



          When the lilac was fresh

               With its glory of leaves,

          And the swallows came fluttering

               Under the eaves?

          When the bluebird flashed by

               Like a magical thing,

          And you looked for a fairy

               Astride of his wing?



          When the clear, running water,

               Like tinkling of bells,

          Bore along the bare roadside

               A song of the dells,--

          And the mornings were fresh

               With unfailing delight,

          While the sweet summer hush

               Always came with the night?



          O' daffy-down-dilly,

               With robings of gold I

          As our hearts every year

               To your coming unfold,

          And sweet memories stir

               Through the hardening mould,

          We feel how earth's blossomings

               Surely are given

          To keep the soul fresh

               For the spring-time of heaven!




BAA, BAA, BLACK SHEEP!


               "Baa, baa, black sheep!

                    Have you any wool?

               Yes, sir,--no, sir,--

                    Three bags full.

               One for my master,

                    One for my dame,

               And one for the little boy

                    That lives in the lane."


|T is the same question as of old;

               And still the doubter saith,

          "Can any good be made to come

          From out of Nazareth?"



          No sheep so black in all the flock,--

               No human heart so bare,--

          But hath some warm and generous stock

               Of kindliness to share.



          It may be treasured secretly

               For dear ones at the hearth;

          Or be bestowed by stealth along

               The by-ways of the earth;--



          And though no searching eye may see,

               Nor busy tongue may tell,

          Perchance, where largest love is laid,

               The Master knoweth well!






THE TWISTER.


          A twister, in twisting, would twist him a twist,

          And, twisting his twists, seven twists he doth twist:

          If one twist, in twisting, untwist from the twist,

          The twist, untwisting, untwists the twist."


|A ravelled rainbow overhead

          Lets down to life its varying thread:

          Love's blue,--Joy's gold,--and, fair be-

                    tween,

          Hope's shifting light of emerald green;

          With, either side, in deep relief,

          A crimson Pain,--a violet Grief.



          Wouldst thou, amid their gleaming hues,

          Clutch after those, and these refuse?

          Believe,--as thy beseeching eyes

          Follow their lines, and sound the skies,--

          There, where the fadeless glories shine,

          An unseen angel twists the twine.



          And be thou sure, what tint so e'er

          The broken rays beneath may wear,

          It needs them all, that, broad and white,

          God's love may weave the perfect light!






FANTASY.


               "I have a little sister,

                    They call her peep, peep;

               She wades through the water,

                    Deep, deep, deep;

               She climbs up the mountains,

                    High, high, high; '

               My poor little sister,

               She has but one eye!"


|Rough Common Sense doth here confess

               Her kinship to Imagination;

          Betraying also, I should guess,

               Some little pride in the relation.



[Illustration: 0109]

          For even while vexed, and puzzled too,

               By the vagaries of the latter,--

          Fearful what next the child may do,--

               She looks with loving wonder at her.



          Plain Sense keeps ever to the road

          That's beaten down and daily trod;

          While Fancy fords the rivers wide,

          And scrambles up the mountain-side:

          By which exploits she's always getting

          Either a tumble or a wetting.



          While simple Sense looks straight before,

          Fancy "peeps" further, and sees more;

          And yet, if left to walk alone,

               May chance, like most long-sighted people,

          To trip her foot against a stone

               While gazing at a distant steeple.



          Nay, worse! with all her grace erratic,

          And feats aerial and aquatic,

          Her flights sublime, and moods ecstatic,

          She of the vision wild and high

          Hath but a solitary eye!

          And,--not to quote the Scripture, which

          Forebodes the falling in the ditch,--

          Doubtless by following such a guide

          Blindly, in all her wanderings wide,

          The world, at best, would get o' one side.



          What then? To rid us of our doubt

               Is there no other thing to do

          But we must turn poor Fancy out,

               And only downright Fact pursue?



          Ah, see you not, bewildered man!

          The heavenly beauty of the plan?

          'T was so ordained, in counsels high,

               To give to sweet Imagination

          A single deep and glorious eye;

               But then't was meant, in compensation,

          That Common Sense, with optics keen,--

          As maid of honor to a queen,--

          On her blind side should always stay,

          And keep her in the middle way.






JINGLING AND JANGLING.


               "Little Jack Jingle

          Used to live single.

               But when he got tired

                    Of that kind of life,

               He left off being single,

                    And lived with his wife."


|Your period's pointed, most excellent Moth-

                    er!

          Pray what did he do when he tired of the

                    other?

          For a man so deplorably prone to ennui

          But a queer sort of husband is likely to be.



          The fatigue might recur,--and, in case it

                    should be so,

          Why not take a wife on a limited lease, O?

          Grant the privilege, pray, to his idiosyn-

                    crazy,--

          Some natures won't bear to be too closely

                    pinned, you see,--

          And, at worst, the poor Benedict might

                    advertise,

          When weary, at length, of the light of his

                    eyes,--

          Or failing to find her, it may be, in salt,--

          "Disposed of, indeed, for no manner of

                    fault,"

          (To borrow a figure of speech from the

                    mart,)

          "But because the late owner has taken a

                    start!"



          I believe once before you have cautiously

                    said

          Something quite as concise on this delicate

                    head,

          When distantly hinting at "needles and

                    pins,"

          And that "when a man marries, his trouble

                    begins";

          But I don't recollect that you ever pretend

                    To prophesy anything as to the _end_.



          Unless we may learn it of Peter,--the

                    bumpkin,

          Renowned for naught else but his eating

                    of pumpkin;

          Whose wife--I don't see how he happened

                    to get her--

          Had a taste, very likely, for things that

                    were better:



          Since, fearing to lose her, at last it be-

                    fell

          He bethought him of shutting her up in a

                    shell;

          By which brilliant contrivance she _kept_ very

                    well!

          What he did with her next, the old rhyme

                    does n't say,

          But she seems to be somehow got out of

                    the way,

          For the ill-fated Peter was wedded once

                    more,

          To find his bewilderment worse than be-

                    fore;

          "If the first for her spouse had but small

                    predilection,

          Now 't was his turn, alas! to fall short in

                    affection.



          And how do you think that he conquered

                    the evil?

          Why, simply by _lifting himself to her level_;

          By leaving his pumpkins, and learning to

                    spell,

          He came, saith the story, to love her right

                    well;

          And the mythical memoir its moral con-

THE OLD WOMAN OF SURREY.


          "There was an old woman in Surrey,

          Who was morn, noon, and night in a hurry;

               Called her husband a fool,

               Drove the children to school,

          The worrying old woman of Surrey."


|T was an ancient earldom over the sea,

          And it must be now as it used to be;

          Yet the sketch is of one I have known

                    before,--

          The very old woman that lives next door.



          One thing is unquestionable,--she 's

                    "smart,"--

          As they say of an apple that's rather tart;

          For her nearest friends, I think, would

                    allow her

          To be, at her best, but a "pleasant sour."

          There's a certain electrical atmosphere

          That you feel beforehand, when she's near:

          And--unless you 'ye a wonderful deal of

                    pluck--

          A shrinking fear that you might be

                    "struck."



          She moves with such a bustle and rush,--

          Such an elemental stir and crush,

          As makes the branches bend and fall

          In the breeze that blows up a thunder-squall.

          And yet, it is only her endless "hurry";

          She's not so bad if she would n't "worry."

          And, for all the worlds that she has to make.

          If the six days' time she 'd only take.



          You may talk about Surrey, or Devon, or

                    Kent,

          But I doubt if a special location was meant;

          It may sound severe,--but it seems to me

          That a "representative" woman was she;



          And that here and there you may chance

                    to trace

          Some specimens extant of the race:

          For a slip of the stock, as I've a notion,

          Somehow "in the Mayflower" crossed the

                    ocean.






PICKLE PEPPERS.


          "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickle peppers;

               And a peck of pickle peppers Peter Piper picked;

          If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickle peppers

               Where's the peck of pickle peppers Peter Piper

                    picked?"




|Poor Peter toiled his life away,

          That afterward the world might say

          "Where is the peck of peppers he

          Did gather so industriously?"

          The peppers are embalmed in metre,--

          But who, alas! inquires for Peter?



          In sun or storm, by night and day,

          Scant time for sleep, and none for play,

          Still the poor fool did nothing reck,

          If only he might pick his peck:

          And what result from all hath sprung,

          But just to bite somebody's tongue?

          Or,--Lady Fortune playing fickle,--

          Get some one in a precious pickle?






HUMPTY DUMPTY.


          "Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall;

          Humpty Dumpty had a great fall:

          Not all the king's horses nor all the king's men

          Could set Humpty Dumpty up again."


|Full many a project that never was hatched

          Falls down, and gets shattered beyond be-

                    ing patched;

          And luckily, too! for if all came to chick-

                    ens,

          Then things without feathers might go to

                    the dickens.



          If each restless unit that moves among men

          Might climb to a place with the privileged

                    "ten,"

          Pray tell us where all the commotion would

                    stop!

          Must the whole pan of milk, forsooth, rise

                    to the top?



          If always the statesman attained to his hopes,

          And grasped the great helm, who would

                    stand by the ropes?

          Or if all dainty fingers their duties might

                    choose,

          Who would wash up the dishes, and polish

                    the shoes?



          Suppose every aspirant writing a book

          Contrived to get published, by hook or by

                    crook;

          Geologists then of a later creation

          Would be startled, I fancy, to find a forma-

                    tion

          Proving how the poor world did most wo-

                    fully sink

          Beneath mountains of paper, and oceans of

                    ink!



          Or even suppose all the women were mar-

                    ried;

          By whom would superfluous babies be car-

                    ried?

          Where would be the good aunts that should

                    knit all the stockings?

          Or nurses, to do up the singings and rock-

                    ings?

          Wise spinsters, to lay down their wonderful

                    rules,

          And with theories rare to enlighten the

                    fools,--

          Or to look after orphans, and primary

                    schools?



          No! Failure's a part of the infinite plan;

          Who finds that he can't, must give way to

                    who can;

          And as one and another drops out of the

                    race,

          Each stumbles at last to his suitable place.



          So the great scheme works on,--though,

                    like eggs from the wall,

          Little single designs to such ruin may fall,

          That not all the world's might, of its horses

                    or men,

          Could set their crushed hopes at the sum-

SUNDAY AND MONDAY.


               "As Tommy Snooks and Bessy Brooks

                    Were walking out one Sunday,

               Says Tommy Snooks to Bessy Brooks,

                    To-morrow will be Monday."


|No doubt you are smiling at such a remark.

          And thinking poor Snooks but a pitiful

                    spark;

          But the words have a meaning, worth look-

                    ing for, too,

               As I'll presently try and demonstrate for you.



          'Twas a pity, indeed, in that moment of

                    leisure,

          To dampen poor Bessy's hebdomadal pleas-

                    ure,

          That he to his toiling, and she to her

                    tub,

          Must turn, and take up with another week's

                    rub;

          Yet a truth for us all, since the shade of

                    the real

          Follows fast on the track of each sunny

                    ideal.



          Now and then we may pause on Life's

                    pleasant oases;

          But between lie the desert's grim, desolate

                    spaces;

          Yet for Snooks and his Bessy,--for me

                    and for you,--

          Comes a Saturday night when the wage

                    will be due;

Sunday!"






THE MAD HORSE.


               "There was a mad man,

                    And he had a mad wife,

               And the children were mad beside;

                    So on a mad horse

                    They all of them got,

               And madly away did ride."


|Sagacious Goose! Fresh wonders yet!

          "What spell had power to help you get

          Those seven-leagued spectacles, that see

          After the lightning then they ran,

          Caught him,--and now they drive the

P. S.--1870.

          The great Pacific railroad's done;

          They've poured two oceans into one:

          Two shores with whispering cable tied,

          And cut a path for ships to ride,

          Where camel-tracks had used to be,

          Through desert sands, from sea to sea.

          _Moon_, quoth I? Faith, they 've _made_ a

                    moon!

          Leastwise, they 've _thought_ one; * and so

1882.

          Why put a double P. S. in?

          'T would need a daily bulletin

          To tell how fast the craze goes on,

          With Keeley and with Edison;

          With things to eat, and things to travel,--

          Bicycles spinning o'er the gravel,--

          Great guns to simplify the fights,--

          Suns outshone with electric lights,--

          The whisper in the closet stirred

          In sooth across the housetops heard,

          And when the airy tangle tires

          Earth to be veined with throbbing wires.



          Women to physic and to preach,

          And help the national bird to screech;

          One man on Wall-Street curb to stand,

          With twenty railroads in his hand;

          Schools for the mass, effecting this,

ROSES AND DIAMONDS.

               Little girl, little girl, what gave she you?

               She gave me a diamond as big as my shoe."


|If the old could share with the young

          If faces could wear their roses again.

|Ah, the world hath many a Horner,

FUNERAL HOLIDAY.

|There was never a drama of sorrow

               But good folks might be found, I'm afraid,

          Who a queer satisfaction could borrow

               From the parts of importance they played.



          There is war for four years in the nation:

               There are havoc and panic abroad:

          Comes a tempest; a wild conflagration:

               Great souls go up home to their God.



          How the tall I's spring thick in the spell-

                    ing!--

               I knew, or I saw, or I said!--

          How the small ones turn out to the swelling

               Each splendor of final parade!



          How many are left, we may wonder,

               Heart-mournful for that which befell?

          How many would wish back the blunder

               "When the Cat has got into the Well!



          Nay, more; if with infinite bother

          Somehow, one boy seems famous as t' other,

               John Green is as big as John Stout!



          See, now! let me tell you a story

               Of something which happened in sooth;

          That shows with how fearless a glory

               The children and simple speak truth.



          Biddy came to her mistress refulgent;

               A whole sunrise of smiles on her face;

          'With w M'am, could ye be so indulgent

               Jist to shpare me the day, if ye plase?



          "It 's me cousin that 's dead,--Kate

                    M'Gawtherin,--

               Was married to Barnaby Roach;

          An' I 'd want,--but I hates to be both-

          And so we were minus our dinners;

               And all that deplorable day

          We fasted, like penitent sinners,

               While Biddy the cook was away.



          But she came when the sunset was gleam-

                    ing;

               And her story she gleefully told;

          Disdaining all dolorous seeming,

               In a way that was good to behold.



          Each loving and sad recollection

               Of the late Mrs. Barnaby Roach

          Quite absorbed in the single reflection

               That she "wint wid himsel' in the coach!"



          "For he thrated me, faith, like a lady,

               An' he paid me me fare, an' ahl;

          An' he tould me that I, Bridget Brady,

               Was the charm of the funeral!"






DISROBED.


               "There was a little woman, as I've heard tell,

               She went to market her eggs for to sell:

               She went to market all on a market day,

               And she fell asleep on the king's highway.



               "There came a little peddler, his name was Stout;

               He cut off her petticoats round about:

               He cut off her petticoats up to her knees,

               And the poor little woman began for to freeze.



               "She began to shiver, and she began to cry,

               Lawk-a-mercy on me! sure it is n't I!

               But if it be I, as I think it ought to be,

|I think of a poor, tired Soul,

                    That has trodden, up and down,

               The tradeways of this busy life,

                    To and from its market town,

               Till, traffic and toil all past,

                    At the silent close of the day,

               She lies down, weary and worn, at last,

                    On the king's highway;--



               The highway that brings all home,

                    Never a one left out;--

               And in her sleep doth a Stranger come

                    Who cuts her garments about.

               Cuts the life-tatters away,

                    All the old rags and the stain;

          And leaves the Soul 'twixt her night and

                    day,

               To waken again.



               Slowly she wakens, and strange;

                    Strange and scared she doth seem;

               Marvelling at the mystical change

                    Come over her in her dream.



               "Where is my life?" she cries,

                    "That which I knew me by?

               Something is here in an unknown guise:

                    Can it be I?



               "I wonder if anything is:

                    Or if I am anything:

               Did ever a Soul come bare as this

                    From its earthward marketing?

               Let me think down into the past;

                    Bethink me hard in the cold;

               Find me something to stand by fast;

                    Something to hold!"



          She thinks away back to the morning,

               To something she loved and knew;

          And over her doubt comes dawning

               Sense of the dear and true.



          "I do n't know if it be I," she sighs;

               "But if after all it be,

          There 's a little heart at home in the skies,

               And he 'll know me!"




JACK AND JILL.


               "Jack and Jill

                    Went up the hill,

               To draw a pail of water:

                    Jack fell down

                    And broke his crown,

               And Jill came tumbling after."


|Jack and Jill went up the hill,

               When the world was young, together.

          Jack and Jill went up the hill,

               In Eden ways and weather.

          She to seek out blessed springs,

               He to bear the burden:

          Nature their sole choice of things,

               Love their only guerdon.

          That was all the simple creatures knew.



          Jack and Jill come down the hill,

               In the world's fall years, together.

          Jack and Jill come down the hill,

               And there is stormy weather.

          'T is all about the _pail_, you see;

               The sweet springs are behind them:

          Empty-handed seemeth she

               Who only helped to find them.

          Jill would like to swing a bucket, too.



          O'er the hillside coming down,

               Eagerly and proudly,

          Sparkling trophies to the town

               To bear, she clamors loudly.

          But, in face of all the town,

               Challenging its laughter,

          Many a Jack comes tumbling down.

               Shall the Jills come after?

          _Is_ that what the women want to do?



               Listen! When on heights of life

                    Hidden pools He planted,

               God to Adam and his wife

                    Wise division granted.

               Gave his son the pitcher broad

                    For wealth and weight of water;

               But the quick divining-rod

                    Confided to his daughter.

               Ah, if men and women only knew!






CASUS BELLI.


Impromptu, July, 1870.

               "The sow came in with the saddle;

               The little pig rocked the cradle;

               The dish jumped up on the table

               To see the pot swallow the ladle;

               The spit that stood behind the door

               Threw the pudding-stick on the floor.

                    "Odsplut!" said the gridiron,

|Spain came in with an empty throne;

          The little prince rocked his German cradle

               "No, no," he said;

               And he shook his head;

          "I am well content to be let alone."

          All the dishes on pantry-ledge

          And shelf, and table, were up on edge,

                    To see how the Pot,

                    Simmering hot,

          Would foam at the dip of the threatening

                    ladle.



          Nothing befell for a minute or so,

          (Nobody chose to be first, you know),

          Till the royal spit, with an angry frown,

          Threw a little pudding-stick down.

          "Odsplut!" shouts Emperor Gridiron,

               Hissing for a broil,

          "Those folks that stand behind the door

               Are getting up a coil!

          I 've red Fire panting at my feet;

THE DAYS THAT ARE LONG.


                    "I'll sing you a song

                    To sin and sorrow:

               Over her limit her hard lash flings

                    Into God's morrow.



               Measures His dear divine grace

                    In compass narrow:

               Counts for nothing the infinite days;

                    Forgets the sparrow.



               The world sings only a half song;

                    Leaves our hearts sore:

               Heaven, in the time that is tender and long,

                    Will sing us more.






THREESCORE AND TEN.


               "How many miles to Babylon?

                    Threescore and ten.

               Can I get there by candle-light?

                    Yes, and back again."


|How many miles of the weary way?

               Threescore miles and ten.

          Where shall I be at the end of the day?

               Yon shall be back again.



          You shall prove it all in the lifelong round;

                    The joy, and the pain and the sinning;

          And at candle-light your soul shall be found

               Back--at its new beginning.



          Down in his grave the old man lies;

               In from the earthward wild,

          At the open door of Paradise

               Enters a little child.






TWO LITTLE BLACKBIRDS.


          "Two little blackbirds sat upon a stone;

          One flew away, and then there was one;

          The other flew after and then there was none;

          So the poor stone was left all alone."

          One of these little birds back again flew;

          The other came after, and then there were two;

          Says one to the other, pray, how do you do?

          Very well, thank you, and, pray, how are you?


|A stone is the barest fact:

                    But living and wonderful things

               Gather to earthly occasion and act

                    With folded or parting wings.



          Birds of the air are they,--

               Our knowledge, our thought, our love,--

          And the ethers in which they win their way

               Are breaths of the heaven above.



          Some place and point of the hour,--

               The same little fact for two,--

          Who knoweth the lasting wonder and power

               It holdeth for me and you;



          Away in the long-past years,

               With trifle of merest chance,

          Keeping, through losing, and blinding, and

                    tears,

               The key of its circumstance?



          I, left to the narrowed earth,--

               You into the great heaven gone,--

          And things of our sharing,--our work, our

                    mirth,--

          So lonely to brood upon!



          Yet ever, when thought recurs,

               With hardly a reckoning why,

          To some old, small memory, straightway stirs

               That sound of wings in the sky;



          And like birds to a resting-place,--

               No longer one, but the two,--

          Alight the remembrances, face to face,

               Alive between me and you;



          And heaven grows real and dear,

               And earth widens up to heaven;

          And all that had vanished, and stayed so

                    near,

               In one marvellous glimpse is given.



          For memory is return:

               Ourselves are what we have been:

          And what we have been together, we learn

               Our life doth continue in.



          Spread, then, the angel wings!

               I lose you not as you go;

          Since heart finds heart in the uttermost

                    things

               Two thoughts may revisit so!






TAFFY.


               'Taffy was a Welshman,

                    Taffy was a thief;

               Taffy came to my house

                    And stole a piece of beef:

               I went to Taffy's house,

                    Taffy was n't at home;

               Taffy came to my house

               And stole a marrow bone:

               I went to Taffy's house,

                    Taffy was in bed;

               I took the marrow bone,

                    And beat about his head."


|Old Time came unto my house of clay,

          And pilfered its pride of flesh away:

          I knocked at the doors of the years in vain

          To ask for its goodliness again.

          Old Time came unto me yet once more,

          For crueller theft than he thieved before;

          Stealing the very marrow and bone

          That the strength of my life was builded on.

          Old Time! At last thou shalt lie in thy bed,

          And thy years and days be buried and

                    dead;

          And the strength of the life to come shall

                    be

          In the great revenge I will have of thee!




MARGERY DAW.


               "See, saw! Margery Daw

               Sold her bed, and lay upon straw;

               Sold her straw, and lay upon dirt;

               Was n't she a good-for-naught?"


|O Margery Daw! Mistress Margery Daw!

     Not yours the sole lapse that the world ever

                    saw!

          In precisely such willful gradation

     I fear me religion and morals and law

     Go down, step by step, to the dirt through

                    the straw,

               In the church and the mart and the nation.



     A yielding of that, and a dropping of this,--

     ("With straw fresh and plenty, pray what

                    is amiss?

          The bed may be wider and cleaner;" )

     Ah, that's as you make it, and shake it,

                    you 'll find;

     And with slumber forgetful, and luxury

               blind,

          What you rest in grows meaner and

                    meaner.



     "In righteousness walking," the Scripture

                    verse goes,--

     "They rest in their beds," and find blessed

                    repose;

          And the beautiful contrary diction

     Is neither Isaiah's mistake, nor a word

     At random declared, to be scoffingly heard,

          But a truth in the freedom of fiction.



     O Margery Daw! Mistress Margery Daw!

     It shall always be gospel, what always was

                    law:

          Some bed-making none may dispense

                    with,--

     In dust of the earth, or in heart of the

                    heaven,--

     And to soul of mankind shall no Sabbath be

                    given

          Save that it lies down and contents with.






TROUBLED WITH RATS.


               "Pretty John Watts,

               We are troubled with rats;

          Will you drive them out of the house?

               There are mice, too, in plenty,"

               Who feast in the pantry;

               But let them stay,

               And nibble away;

          What harm in a little brown mouse?"


|A curious puzzle haunts

               The brain of the commentator,

          Whether John Watts, perchance,

               Be preacher or legislator.



          We 're troubled with rats, we cry:

               And who shall drive out the vermin?

          Let senate and pulpit try:

               Urge edict, and scourge with sermon.



          They steal, they riot, they slay:

               They are noisy, they are noisome:

          Mice in the pantry, you say?

               Ah, those little things are toysome!



          They only nibble, you see;

               They only frolic and scamper:

          What harm can it possibly be

          A little brown mouse to pamper?



          They 're not of the race, John Watts!

               From them we need no protection;

          They will never develop to rats,

               By survival or selection.



          And yet, John Watts! John Watts!

               Whether in closet or highway,

          I doubt me that mice and rats

               _Are_ akin, in some sort of sly way;



          And as long as the world sins on,

               That the odds will be but a quibble

          Between the deeds that are done

               By brutes that devour--or nibble!

               Two merry legs to the four, lad!



          A quick, bold pair, that scampers fair, is

               part of the saving plan,

                    And a match for the pad

          There 's death in our work, there's fear to

                    lurk in the places where we played.

          "When I was a bachelor, I lived by myself,

          And all the bread and cheese I got I put upon a shelf.

          The rats and the mice, they made such a strife,

          I was forced to go to London to get me a wife.

          The streets were so broad, and the lanes were so nar-

                    row

          I was forced to bring my wife home in a wheelbarrow.

          The wheelbarrow broke, and my wife had a fall,

          Down came wheelbarrow, wife, and all."


|Of course it did. Whatever could you pos-

                    sibly expect, sir?

          You chose a quite peculiar style to cherish

                    and protect, sir!

          Your resource in emergency commands my

                    admiration,

          But I wonder was it want--or excess--of

                    calculation,

               That the wheelbarrow broke?



          The one-wheeled way gave out, you say?

               Indeed, I should have guessed so,

          From the very frank preamble of your pre-

                    cious manifesto!

          When all the bread and cheese you got you

                    shut up in your closet,

          Driving such single-blessed team, what

                    strange amazement was it

               That your wheelbarrow broke?



          You were managing quite finely till the rats

                    and mice got at it,

          And forced you to the slow resolve, how-

                    e'er you might combat it

          With other prompting, that a wife must be

                    your choice of crosses

          In a world of moth and rust and thieves,

                    and all provoking losses?

               Yes,--the wheelbarrow broke.



          When the scramble and the screed began,

                    you fain would share your trouble,

          But in no other sense, it seems, arrange for

                    going double;

          The generous thoroughfares of life were too

                    wide for your barrow,

          And the single footpath in the lane you

                    plodded was too narrow

               For a couple in a yoke.



          The old plan was a careful one; but it could

                    never carry

          New needs; you should have thought of

                    that before you thought to marry;

     And still you strove to push it through,

                    with many a frown and grumble,

          Till the poor little wife and all had got a

                    dreadful tumble,

               When the wheelbarrow broke.



          Broke midway in the struggle: a providen-

                    tial mystery:

          The usual meek accounting for of such mis-

                    handled history:

          As if it were the method of the wisdom and

                    the glory

          To run the earth on one wheel,--and each

                    small earthly story,--

               Till the wheelbarrow broke!



          Ah, friend! of God's mechanics you mistake

                    the grand solution;

          On no weak, single centre runs the perfect

                    revolution;

          But one circuit round the sun,--one self-

                    circling for the planet,--

          And one divine consent of both,--so first

                    the power began it,

               And creation was bespoke.



          Be sure you must in everything waste hope

                    and love and labor,

          Moving cheaply by yourself,--nowise

                    greatly with your neighbor.

          Cease, then, with such ill-balance in the

                    ways of life to wraxle,

          And put an equal-turning wheel on each

                    end of your axle,

THE FOOTPATH WAY.


          "Jog on, jog on, the footpath way,

               And merrily jump the stile, O!

          A merry heart goes all the day,

               Your sad one tires in a mile, O!"


|Who goes to-day by the footpath way,

          When with ocean leagues the steamships

                    play,

          And under mountains and over plains

          Runs the level thunder of the trains?



          Who goes to-day by the footpath way,

          When the very babies despise great A,

          And swallow, with supercilious smiles,

          Whole sentences, like young crocodiles?



          Who goes to-day by the footpath way,

          Waiting for good things until he can pay,

          When with mortgage and loan and instal-

                    ment plan,

          Life is let furnished to every man?



          Who goes to-day by the footpath way,

          When Moses made awful mistakes, they

                    say,

          And the story of all that began and is

          Never happened according to Genesis?



          Who goes to-day by the footpath way,

          Alone and straitened, with care and de-

                    lay,

          When the world, grown wiser by grace of

                    God,

          Rolls assured toward heaven on the cause-

                    way broad?  .

          When things are thus since they must be so,

          And nobody stands by himself, you know,

          And none may jog onward, and none may

                    fall

          But by force that prevails in the general?



          And what are the odds of tear or smile,

          Or whether we merrily leap the stile

          Or tumble helpless, since over we must,

          And the end of all is the "dust to dust?"



          Well,--take it so; yet the footpath way

          Doth its line through every thoroughfare

                    lay;

          The tramp of the legion may seem to efface,

          But the single treading hath left its trace.



          You may rush by steam with a seven-league

                    stride,

          Yet the footpath way's in the railroad

                    ride;

          Each goes his own gait, and clears his own

                    stiles,

          And lives by inches, while driven by miles.



          You may scorn your penny, and spend your

                    pound,

          No less't will appear, when the day comes

                    round,

          That farthing by farthing the score was

                    made,

          And unto the uttermost shall be paid.



          And Moses will stand when philosophies

                    drop,

          And Huxley and Darwin have shut up

                    shop;

          For whatever you jump, and however you

                    jog,

          You can't get away from the decalogue.



          Then with faith and fear in the footpath

                    way,

          And with steadfast cheer, trudge on, we

                    say;

          For if ever earth into the kingdom rolls,

          'T will be by the saving of single souls!






UP A TREE.


          "Oh dear, what can the matter be?

          Two old women got up in an apple-tree:

               One came down,

          And the other stayed up till Saturday."


|I suppose you wonder how it should be

          That two old ladies got up in a tree:

          Did you never chance the exploit to see?



          Perhaps you have noticed pussy-cat go,

          With a wrathful look, and a way not

                    slow,

          And a tail very big, and a back up--

                    so?



[Illustration: 0195]

          Well, that is the type of the thing I mean;

          And the apple-bearer, since earth was

                    green,

          The tree of our trouble hath always been.



          So when "human warious" fails to agree,

          There stands the old stem of iniquity,

          And one or both will be "up a tree."



          Each in her style: some are stately and

                    stiff;

          Some hiss and spit, and are up in a whiff;

          And some hunch along in a moody miff.



          It does n't much matter, however it be;

          The best of people may get up the tree;

          The question is, when they 'll come down,

                    you see!



          An offenseless one will descend straightway;

          One half in the wrong for a while may stay;

          Clear curstness will roost till the judgment

                    day!




THE CROOKED MAN.


               "There was a crooked man,

               And he went a crooked mile;

               He found a crooked sixpence

               Against a crooked stile:

               He bought a crooked cat,

               Which caught a crooked mouse;

               And they all lived together

               In a little crooked house."


|Once begin with a crook,

               You 'll go on with a crook;

          Crooked ways, crooked luck, crooked peo-

                    ple.

               Crooked eyes, crooked mind,

               Crooked guideposts will find;

          Yes, a crook in the very church-steeple!



               The first mile you make

               The initial will take

          For all the long leagues that shall follow:

               Right and left, fork and swerve,

               Any turn that will serve,

          Up and down, betwixt hummock and hol-

                    low.



               If you pause at a stile

               Or a fence for a while,

          Some twist must compel or invite you:

               Even sin, I've a doubt,

               Were it straight out and out,

          Could hardly persuade or delight you.



               And a shave, or a bend,

               Or a nick, must commend,

          For you, every quarter and nickel:

               Right pure from the mint,

               There were no magic in't

          Your trick-loving finger to tickle.



               Crooked money will buy

               But a crook or a lie,

          Whatever the ware that you deal in

               Your position in life,

               Your companions, your wife,

          Or even a playfellow feline



               And as thief catches thief

               In the common belief,

          Be the creature a cat or a woman,

               The crooked shall still

               Find the crooked at will,

          And you 'll see the old saw sayeth true, man.

               In kin, neighbors, house,

               In a servant or mouse,

          She will always put paw on her likeness:

               The same rule runs through,

               For the false and the true,--

          Straight to straight, and oblique to oblique-

                    ness.



               So together, you see,

               As you build, you shall be,

          Every line of the mould in the casting;

               And a nice little world

               You 'll have made, when you 've

                    curled

          And squirmed to your state everlasting!






THE FOUR WINDS.


               "When the wind is in the east,

               'T is neither good for man nor beast;

               When the wind is in the north,

               The skillful fisher goes not forth;

               When the wind is in the south,

               It blows the bait in the fishes' mouth;

               When the wind is in the west,

               Then't is at the very best."


|Life, like the earth, to the east doth run,

          Turning her face to the face of the sun.

          The wind that is contrary, as she goes,

          Is always the bitterest wind that blows;

          Smiting the kiss of the shining away,

          And beating backward the beautiful day.

          The wind that comes from the icy pole

          Shutteth up hope in the human soul;

          Chiding the heart, and forbidding the will,

          And blasting our very beginnings with ill.

          Oh, the wind of the north, on its terrible

                    path,

          Is the wind of wreck, and despair, and

                    wrath!



          The breath that blows from the climes of

                    ease,

          From the isles of spice and the bread-fruit

                    trees,

With its unearned flavors to fill the mouth;

The zephyr that sends from the idle south

Its soft beguiling and treacherous touch,--

Let the soul in her struggle be shy of

such!



          But the wind that springs from the hind-

                    ward side,

          And as earth rolls under sweeps over the

                    tide;

          The gust that is vigorous, brave, and true,

          Backing you up in whatever you do,

          Keen and impelling, the wind of the west,--

          Ah, well saith the legend, that breeze is the

                    best.






THE PIPER AND THE COW.


          "There was a piper had a cow,

               And he had naught to give her:

          So he took up his pipes, and he played her a tune,

               Consider, cow,--consider!

          The cow considered very well,

               And gave the piper a penny;

          And bade him play the other tune,--

               Corn-rigs are bonny."


|Good folks of the pen, I am sure you 'll

                    agree

     That author and publisher here we may see:

     The Piper plays tunes 'twixt the world and

                    the Cow,

     And he has, at the same time, the care of

                    the mow:

     When the crop in the barn shows but little

                    to feed her,

     To the Cow quoth the Piper, Consider, con-

                    sider!



     The Cow is a creature that cheweth the cud;

     Recalleth the hill-sides, with daisies be-

                    stud,

     The sweet running waters, the breezes at

                    play,

     While mournfully munching the last lock of

                    hay:

     All the world that she knoweth of fra-

                    grance and stir

     Sealeth up in those dry stems its juices for

                    her.



     So it cometh, forsooth, that because she can

                    chew

     People think it is all she can hunger to do:

     Neither Public nor Piper doth fully allow

     For the interdependence of mood and of

                    mow,

     Or see how perplexing it may be, alas,

     For a Oow to consider between hay and

                    grass!



     Howbeit, if Mooly considereth well,

     And giveth the Piper good milk for to sell,

     The Piper he maketh his own modest

                    penny,--

     Just one at a time, till he hath a great

                    many;

     And during the while this is coming to pass

     Fresh fodder grows plenty, and delicate

                    grass.



     Once more life's a pasture; the season is

                    June;

     The pipes play up cheerly the bonny-rig

                    tune;

     The Cow is in clover; the buttercups hold

     Right up to her chin their probation of

                    gold;

     But she knows, all the same, how't will be

                    when they bid her

     So, so, dear mistress pussy, pray tell me how you do!

     I thank you, little dog, I am very well just now."


|Behind the log, in the reek and mould,

               How many poor things are there,

          Who else might be sought, and caressed,

                    and told,

               So tenderly, they were fair!



     Behind the log, ah, behind the log,

SHOE AND FIDDLE.


               "Cock-a-doodle-doo!

               My dame has lost her shoe;

               My master's lost his fiddlestick,

               And does n't know what to do."



          Who's crowing, I wonder, to spread such

                    a scandal

          Of the blithe-tripping dame who hath

                    dropped off her sandal,

          And seemeth all sad and forlornly to

                    shirk,

          Where she used, in good hmnor, to dance

                    at her work?



          Perhaps honest chanticleer simply may

                    glory

          In faithfully giving both sides of the story;

          And scorning the loss of the lady to tell

          Without owning the miss of the master as

                    well.



          For how, when the fiddlestick 's gone, can

                    be played

          The music, without which the dancing is

                    stayed?

          When the man 's out of tune, the dear

                    woman, 't is plain,

          Must wait till he graciously strikes up again.

          Let him hunt for his bow, then, and rosin it

                    too,

          (If really he'd like to be told what to do;)

          And I think, with the fiddling, 't will surely

                    be found

          All else will come right for the merry-go-

                    And so the world goes on.



               Shuttlecock and battledore!

                    When will it all be done,--

               The life of the buffet and beat be o'er,

                    And the life of the wings begun?






THE MAN IN THE WILDERNESS.


          "The man in the wilderness, he asked me

          How many strawberries grew in the sea:

          I answered him, as I thought good,

          As many red herrings as grew in the wood."


|Of the face of the world they have found

                    it out

               By what they must fetch and do;

          Of the heart of the world they dispute and

                    doubt,

               And yet it is just as true.



          Your fish is wholesome, and live, and clean,

               And my little fruit is fair;

          Though the earth's good Maker might never

                    mean

               That both should be everywhere.



          And all for the want of a thought like this,

               It comes, and it can but be,

          That many a soul 's in the wilderness,

               And many adrift at sea.






PRAE AND POST.


                    "The man in the moon

                    Came down too soon

               To inquire the way to Norwich;

                    The man in the south,

                    He burnt his mouth

               With eating cold plum porridge."


|The moony men are always in a hurry

          That puts sedater people in a flurry,

          They get their theories through other media

          Than facts of gazetteer or cyclopaedia;

          And then, by some unknown, preposterous

                    gateway,

          Rush forth to claim the realizing straight-

                    way.



          Just think of lighting on a foreign planet,

          Asking for Norwich before folks began it!



          But then, those sleepy souls at the equator

          Lose just as much, you see, by starting

                    later;

          Never strike in while anything is hot,--

          Wait till the porridge is all out o' the

                    pot;--

          And through their indolence and easy fool-

                    ing

          Burn their mouths, figuratively, in the cool-

                    ing!



          Too soon, too slow, there's nothing comes

                    out even;

          The very sun that travels through the

                    heaven

          Heels o'er the line, now this way and now

                    that,

          And only twice a year can hit it pat.

          Even your two eyes make a parallax,

          And might mislead you on two different

                    tracks;

               Between them both, the moral, I suppose,

          Is that each man should follow his own

                    nose!






QUITE CONTRARY.


          "Mistress Mary, quite contrary,

               How does your garden grow?

          With silver bells, and cockle shells,

               And tulips, all of a row."


|Prithee, tell me, Mistress Mary,

          Whence this rhyme of  "quite contrary"?

          Why should Mother Goose, beholding

          All these pleasant blooms unfolding,--

          Every prim and pretty border

          Standing in such shining order,--

          Looking o'er the lovely rows,

          Ask you "how your garden grows"?



          Mary, so precise and chary,

          Are you, anyhow, contrary?

          While these sweetly perfect lines

          Nod their gentle countersigns,

          Spending all your strength on this,

          Lest the least thing grow amiss,

          Weareth some unseen parterre

          Quite a different kind of air?



          Through your hating of a weed

          Runs there any ill to seed,--

          Thistle-blow of petulance,

          Bitter blade of blame, perchance,

          Or a flaunting stem of pride,

          In that other garden-side?

          Mary, in our women-hearts

          Spring such curious counterparts!



          Each her home-plot watching wary,

          Lest the faultless order vary

          By the dropping of a leaf,

          Or a blossom come to grief

          From the blasting of the storm,

          Or the eating of a worm,

          Let us both be certain, Mary,

          Nothing dearer goes contrary!






ALONG, LONG, LONG.


          "As I was going along, long, long,

          A singing a comical song, song, song,

          The lane that I went was so long, long, long,

          And the song that I sung was so long, long, long,

               And so I went singing along."


|It 's all along, and along,

          For the earth is bonny, and glad, and wide,

          And we 're free to wander, and free to bide,

               And we travel with a song.



               It's long, it's wearily long!

          For the path is narrowed to only a lane;

          And we 've sung it over and over again,

               That old, monotonous song.



               Nay, let us be thankful and strong,

          That the breath of life is as long as the day,

          And the song is as long as the weariful way,

               And so, we 'll go singing along!






FINIS.


_(MOTHER GOOSE, INTERLINEATED.)_


|The white dove sat on the castle wall,

          I bent my bow, and shoot her I shall,"--

               (The fair bird, truth, and her meanings;)

          "I put her in my glove, both feathers and

                    all;"

          (The pretty plumes that her flight let fall;

               For I bound in a book my gleanings:)

          "I laid my bridle upon the shelf,--

          If you want any more, you may sing it

                    yourself!"

               (It's all in the wits and the weenings!)






CONCLUSION.


_(EDITORIAL.)_


|Doubtless I might go on to quote,

               With added paraphrase and note,

               Precept on precept, line on line,

               To instance here the fact divine

               That of her children, far and wide,

               Wisdom is always justified.

               Yet why oppress with proof of that,

               Since "verbum sapienti sat"?

               Suffice it to have struck the vein,

                    And shown some specimens of ore;

               If any seek for further gain,

                    The mine still holds abundance more.

               A mental pickaxe and a biggin

               Are all you need to go to diggin'.

               For, as the Swedish seer contends,

               All things comprise an inner sense;

               There's nothing we can write or say,

               In howsoever simple way,

               But seems a body, built to hide

               The soul that straightway is supplied;

               And many a fool, and prophet too,

               Hath spoken wiser than he knew.



               One parting word, and I am gone:

                    If I 've prevailed to make you see

                    These things as they appear to me,

               Then have I proved my Goose a Swan

               And I, small fledgling of the line,

                    Yet proud to bear the ancient name,

               May, for this ancestress of mine,

                    Claim place upon the page of fame;

               That not a bard of Saxon tongue

               More true to nature ever sung:



               More surely soothed, more deeply taught,

               Or passing fact more keenly caught;

               And that--exalted side by side

               With him of Avon, in the pride

               And love of millions--we should lay

               The tribute at her feet to-day

               That owns her, in this latter age,

               Goose, truly,--but, in savor, Sage!

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
