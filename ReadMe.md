# Authorship Identifier

  This repository represents our concerted effort to create a machine learning model which can identify the author of a given text. We have constructed this model to work for up to nearly 10 authors. The authors for whom we have created a model are as follows: Mildred A. Wirt, Oscar Wilde, Mark Twain, Elizabeth Gaskell, George Eliot, Thomas Hardy, Robert Louis Stevenson, Arthur Conan Doyle, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Jack London.
