  Though flattered by imitators galore Miss Potter's work stands supreme.
  Her many picture stories should be among the first books owned by
  children.

  Cecily Parsley lived in a pen,
  And brewed good ale for gentlemen;

  Gentlemen came every day,
  Till Cecily Parsley ran away.

  Goosey, goosey, gander,
    Whither will you wander?
  Upstairs and downstairs,
    And in my lady's chamber!

  This pig went to market;
    This pig stayed at home;

  [Illustration]

  [Illustration]

  This pig had a bit of meat;

  And this pig had none;

  [Illustration]

  [Illustration]

  This little pig cried
      Wee! wee! wee!
  I can't find my way home.

  Pussy-cat sits by the fire;
    How should she be fair?
  In walks the little dog,
    Says "Pussy! are you there?"

  [Illustration]

  "How do you do, Mistress Pussy?
    Mistress Pussy, how do you do?"
  "I thank you kindly, little dog,
    I fare as well as you!"

  Three blind mice, three blind mice,
    See how they run!
  They all run after the farmer's wife,
  And she cut off their tails with a carving knife,
  Did you ever see such a thing in your life
    As three blind mice!

  Bow, wow, wow!
      Whose dog art thou?
  "I'm little Tom Tinker's dog,
      Bow, wow, wow!"

  We have a little garden,
      A garden of our own,
  And every day we water there
      The seeds that we have sown.

  [Illustration]

  We love our little garden,
      And tend it with such care,
  You will not find a faded leaf
      Or blighted blossom there.

  Ninny nanny netticoat,
  In a white petticoat,
      With a red nose,--
  The longer she stands,
      The shorter she grows.
