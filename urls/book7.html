**Welcome To The World of Free Plain Vanilla Electronic Texts**

**Etexts Readable By Both Humans and By Computers, Since 1971**

*These Etexts Prepared By Hundreds of Volunteers and Donations*

Officially released December 31, 1977 [Etext #7] Officially
re-released November 25, 1993 In honor of Thanksgiving

******The Project Gutenberg Etext of The Mayflower Compact*****
******This file should be named 7-h.htm or 7-h.zip*****

We apologize for the fact that the legal small print is longer,
and more complicated, than the Etext itself; our legal beagles,
of whom there are now a half dozen or so, insist this must be a
part of any Project Gutenberg Etext we post, for our protection
from the rest of the legal beagles out there. The US has twice as
many lawyers as the rest of the world combined!

You are free to delete the headers and just keep the Etexts,
we are not free not to post it this way. Again my apologies. The
normal Project Gutenberg blurb has been deleted, you can get it
in this location in most Project Gutenberg Etexts. Thanks, mh

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from someone
other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our fault. So,
among other things, this "Small Print!" statement disclaims most
of our liability to you. It also tells you how you can distribute
copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT By using or reading any part
of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, you indicate that you
understand, agree to and accept this "Small Print!" statement. If
you do not, you can receive a refund of the money (if any) you
paid for this etext by sending a request within 30 days of
receiving it to the person you got it from. If you received this
etext on a physical medium (such as a disk), you must return it
with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERGtm etexts, is a "public domain"
work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart through the Project
Gutenberg Association at Illinois Benedictine College (the
"Project"). Among other things, this means that no one owns a
United States copyright on or for this work, so the Project (and
you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties. Special rules,
set forth below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this
etext under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable efforts
to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain works.
Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any medium they
may be on may contain "Defects". Among other things, Defects may
take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data,
transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual property
infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other etext medium,
a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read
by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES But for the "Right of
Replacement or Refund" described below, [1] the Project (and any
other party you may receive this etext from as a PROJECT
GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all liability to you for damages,
costs and expenses, including legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO
REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH
OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT,
CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE
NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any) you
paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that time to
the person you received it from. If you received it on a physical
medium, you must return it with your note, and such person may
choose to alternatively give you a replacement copy. If you
received it electronically, such person may choose to
alternatively give you a second opportunity to receive it
electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS TO
THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or the
exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the above
disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you may have
other legal rights.

INDEMNITY You will indemnify and hold the Project, its
directors, officers, members and agents harmless from all
liability, cost and expense, including legal fees, that arise
directly or indirectly from any of the following that you do or
cause: [1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration,
modification, or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm" You may distribute
copies of this etext electronically, or by disk, book or any
other medium if you either delete this "Small Print!" and all
other references to Project Gutenberg, or:

[1] Only give exact copies of it. Among other things, this
requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the etext or
this "small print!" statement. You may however, if you wish,
distribute this etext in machine readable binary, compressed,
mark-up, or proprietary form, including any form resulting from
conversion by word pro cessing or hypertext software, but only so
long as *EITHER*:

[*] The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and does
*not* contain characters other than those intended by the author
of the work, although tilde (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_)
characters may be used to convey punctuation intended by the
author, and additional characters may be used to indicate
hypertext links; OR

[*] The etext may be readily converted by the reader at no
expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent form by the
program that displays the etext (as is the case, for instance,
with most word processors); OR

[*] You provide, or agree to also provide on request at no
additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the etext in its
original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC or other equivalent
proprietary form).

[2] Honor the etext refund and replacement provisions of this
"Small Print!" statement.

[3] Pay a trademark license fee to the Project of 20% of the net
profits you derive calculated using the method you already use to
calculate your applicable taxes. If you don't derive profits, no
royalty is due. Royalties are payable to "Project Gutenberg
Association / Illinois Benedictine College" within the 60 days
following each date you prepare (or were legally required to
prepare) your annual (or equivalent periodic) tax return.

WHAT IF YOU *WANT* TO SEND MONEY EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO?
The Project gratefully accepts contributions in money, time,
scanning machines, OCR software, public domain etexts, royalty
free copyright licenses, and every other sort of contribution you
can think of. Money should be paid to "Project Gutenberg
Association / Illinois Benedictine College".

All of the original Project Gutenberg Etexts from the 1970's
were produced in ALL CAPS, no lower case. The computers we used
then didn't have lower case at all.

These original Project Gutenberg Etexts will be compiled into
a file containing them all, in order to improve the content
ratios of Etext to header material.
